Have Markdown Implementations Lost Their Way?
=============================================

                Usage of Markdown can be complex. But this would
                violate a core principle of Markdown. To quote
                the creator [1]:
                
                        "The overriding design goal for
                        "Markdown's formatting syntax is to make
                        "it as readable as possible. The idea is
                        "that a Markdown-formatted document
                        "should be publishable as-is, as plain
                        "text, without looking like itâ€™s been
                        "marked up with tags or formatting
                        "instructions."
                        
                Compare a Markdown file with the above quote.
                How does it stand up?

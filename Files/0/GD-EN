Introduction
============

                GD is a permissive syntax for typesetting human-
                readable text.
                
                GD is not Markdown [DFC].
                
                GD is WYSIWYG. There are no "tags,"
                "metacharacters," etc. A GD interpreter simply
                sends the GD text onto a display device. The
                GNU program cat, invoked with defaults, is a
                GD interpreter.

Character Set
-------------

    Text
    
                A GD text is a sequence of lines.
                
    End-of-Line Marker
                
                A line ends in an end-of-line marker. The end-
                of-line marker is invisible. All end-of-line
                markers in a given GD text should be identical.
                
    Line Length

                The line length of a given line is the number of
                visible characters preceding the end-of-line
                marker.
                
                Line length should not exceed 78.
                
    Visible Characters

                Only visible characters or no characters may
                precede each end-of-line marker.
                
        The Space Character
                
                The space character is visible only if it
                occurs before the last graphic character on a
                line.

    On the Line

                A line may be preceeded by any combination of
                graphic characters and spaces, up to the line
                length.

    Reference Character Set Specification

                If the ASCII character set is used, characters
                corresponding to ASCII codes 33 to 126,
                inclusive, are the only graphic characters.
                The character corresponding to ASCII code 32 is
                conditionally a visible character (see above
                discussion on visible characters). End-of-line
                markers include, but are not limited to code 10,
                code 13, or code 13 followed by code 10.
                
Body Text
---------

                Body text begins sixteen spaces from the
                beginning of a line.
                
Headings (this is an example of an H2 heading)
----------------------------------------------

                An H2 heading beings at the beginning of a line.

    This is an example of an H3 heading.
    
                An H3 heading begins four spaces from the
                beginning of a line.

        This is an example of an H4 heading.

                An H4 heading begins eight spaces from the
                beginning of a line.
        
            This is an example of an H5 heading.
            
                An H5 heading begins twelve spaces from the
                beginning of a line.

                This is an example of an H6 heading.
        
                An H6 heading begins sixteen spaces from the
                beginning of a line.
                
                ANOTHER H6 HEADING
                
                An H6 heading might be easier to distinguish
                from body text if it looks different somehow.
